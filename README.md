# Memory Card game

A fun & interactive card game where you can practice your brain. Check out the screenshots and the instructions below.


## Download && Play

You can download the latest release [here](https://github.com/TommysG/memory-card-game/releases/tag/v1.0). 
You can run the game by running the jar file or the exe file.

[✓] To run the JAR file you'll need JDK 10 and run it only with this one, as it's the only one that pre-inludes JavaFX.
```
"[path_to_jdk_10]\bin\java.exe" -jar MemoryCard.exe
```

[✓] If you don't have it, of course you can  run it by executing the .exe file. (compiled with launch4j)


## Building from source

* Java 8 or Java 10

``` 
git clone https://github.com/TommysG/memory-card-game.git
```

The project will build & run smoothly because JavaFX is integrated in these two JDK versions.

* Java 11 or newer

``` 
git clone https://github.com/TommysG/memory-card-game.git
```

Then you have to download JavaFX externally and add it as a module. 
You can find more info [here](https://openjfx.io/index.html).
